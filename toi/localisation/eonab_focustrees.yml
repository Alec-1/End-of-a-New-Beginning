 csa_own_government:0 "Our Own Government"
 csa_own_government_desc:0 "While our secession attempts have been successfull, we are still a weak coalition of states. In order to acheive our goals and fight for our freedom, we must create a true government separate from the Union."
 csa_establish_constitution:0 "Establish the Constitution"
 csa_establish_constitution_desc:0 "Our nation is based on the American Constitution, promising freedom and liberty to the true owners of America. However, many parts in the current constitution don't fit our views towards promising the rights of slavery to the right people. We must make a few amendments, and establish our own constitution."
 csa_strike_sumter:0 "Strike on Sumter"
 csa_strike_sumter_desc:0 "The time has come. We have ammased all we can, and the time to strike on the unexpecting Union has come. We can no longer resolve our dispute without war, and war is won by first strike."
 csa_war_soldiers:0 "War Won by Soldiers"
 csa_war_soldiers_desc:0 "Some may say a war is won by the generals on the drawing board, or the figureheads in rule, but for all history war was won by the blood spilled on the battlefield by our soldiers. Publicly announcing our support towards the individual soul on the field, and tailoring our war engine towards their victory will surely improve morale, and our achievements."
 csa_quick_surge:0 ""The Quick Surge""
 csa_quick_surge_desc:0 "Our officers have proposed the idea of an operation based on shock and awe, going on a full and quick offense northwards. They assert a swift charge from Virginia to Washington and seizing the Eastern Coast will capitulate the nation fast; perhaps they are right."
 csa_improvise_forts:0 ""Improvise Our Forts""
 csa_improvise_forts_desc:0 "Our governors have shown that a planned defense, and a careful plan of distributing resources could be beneficial for our military constitution of un-proffessional militia. They have demonstrated a strategic and defensive position using natural geography and forts will buy us time to draft more troops and acquire foreign support; perhaps they are right."
 csa_voluntary_forces:0 "Draft Voluntary Forces"
 csa_voluntary_forces_desc:0 "In the immediate time we have a minimal amount of forces, which used to be defensive militia in the Southern States. These forces are hardly enough to defend oursevles from the industrially, technologically superior Union, let alone launch a successfull offense. However, the Confederate States are united under one cause, and encouraging people to join the military through voluntary causes will surely increase our manpower pool in thousands."
 csa_mobilise_militia:0 "Mobilise the Militia"
 csa_mobilise_militia_desc:0 "Our army while is increasing in professional troops, is largely consisted of militia troops defending local provinces. If we were to properly arm these forces, repurpose them and mobilise them to the border regions we would surely benefit from their support. (Currently does nothing)"
 csa_parliamentary_conscript:0 "Parliamentary Conscriptions"
 csa_parliamentary_conscript_desc:0 "Only drafting forces through voluntary propaganda has not proved enough to fuel our war. Making it a law to be a part of the army from the age of 15 to 60 through the Parliament would disrupt public opinion, but certainly improve our current status."
 csa_establish_diplomats:0 "Establish Proper Diplomats"
 csa_establish_diplomats_desc:0 "Our current investment towards diplomacy is non-existent, and would certainly harm us in the ever-changing theatre of the world. If the Union were to ever surmass an alliance against us, things would certainly dire; it is only obvious to invest in preparing properly trained diplomats."
 csa_intern_recog:0 "Request for International Recognition"
 csa_intern_recog_desc:0 "As a nation, only Britain and France barely recognise us as a state, and our worldwide status is at merely a rebellion. To ensure the world theatre accepts us as a proper belligerent in the Civil War and acknowledges our views, we must request several surrounding nations to recognise us as a proper nation."
 csa_inherit_royal:0 "Inherit the Royality"
 csa_inherit_royal_desc:0 "The concept of the British Empire was officially abolished from the continent in the Wars of Independece, but if we were to acknowledge their rule and partially inherit the royalty into our government, we would certainly make strong ties with Britain, and earn a valuable ally."
 csa_second_1812:0 "A Second 1812"
 csa_second_1812_desc:0 "Our war in the South has the Union occupied, and vulnerable to an invasion from the north. Inticing the British Empire and Canada to join the war, despite promising some territorial gains would bring a true shock to the Union, and break their defensive positions."
 csa_revenge_mexico:0 "Avenge the Mexican Eagle"
 csa_revenge_mexico_desc:0 "The Mexicans had cost a pricely defeat in the American-Mexican wars merely decades ago, and their bitter views towards the Union government could be coaxed by us, and convince them to join in a war of revenge. We would have to cede some of our member states, but if their forces were to join any price would be cheap."
 csa_mother_revolution:0 "Mother of the Revolution"
 csa_mother_revolution_desc:0 "Ever since the Revolutionary Wars, the French were an indespensible ally in keeping the British from our bastion of freedom. Time has flowed and we still remain with close relations, but the French perhaps are more sympathetic towards the Union government. This can change if we send proper envoys and solidify relations with the French."
 csa_coalition_revolution:0 "Coalition against the "Home of Liberty""
 csa_coalition_revolution_desc:0 "The Union, the French and our government all boast of being the birthplace of liberty. However, the Union form of liberty is an unstable system that cannot stand, and the aligned views of the French and us hone the true idea. Their views on liberty is unstable, dangerous and contagious, and must be stopped through a coalition against the false views of liberty."
 csa_open_congress:0 "The First Confederate States Congress"
 csa_open_congress_desc:0 "An uncertainty within our government on the idea of slavery has risen, and the people have requested for the goverment to properly discuss this through a Congress. We must accept these demands and promote our views through a democratic process, especially on the topic of slavery."
