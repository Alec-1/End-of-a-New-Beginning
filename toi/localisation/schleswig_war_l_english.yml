 schleswig_war.1.d:0 "After the death of Frederick VII and the crowning of the new king, the question of the independant duchies comes again. Schleswig-Holstein is bordering the German Confederation, but was a part of the danish political sphere for a long time. The annexation of this specific duchy is possible, although it might lead to an opposition from Austria and Prussia."

 schleswig_war.4.d:0 "Prussia announced their opposition to our recent adoption of the November Constitution, as a speaker for the entire German Confederation. If we continue on this path, it will lead most definitly to war between our two country, which also means war against the entire Confederation. We could try it, as our people will see us backing up as a proof of weakness, but it is as our own risks"
 schleswig_war.4.a:0 "Do it anyway"
 schleswig_war.4.b:0 "Let's keep it as an independant duchy"

 schleswig_war.5.t:0 "Denmark refuses to back down"
 schleswig_war.5.d:0 "Denmark refuses our generous offer to stop the annexation of rightous Confederation land. This is seen by many as a clear sign of defiance. Maybe a war could straighten them up."
